Coding project: Counting letter appearance in names.
Requirements:
Please write a program that counts and tracks the appearance of letters in a group of names located in a file.
Example: Single name
Input:
Bob
Output:
b = 2
o = 1
Example: Multiple names
Input:
Robert
Brenda
Paul
Output:
a = 2
b = 2
d = 1
e = 2
l = 1
n = 1
o = 1
p = 1
r = 3
t = 1
u = 1
Submission Parameters:
Please write this project in whatever language you feel strongest in, although Java is preferred and the most
relevant to this position. Please keep the dependencies low. If you are skilled with Maven feel free to use Maven
for your project. Your submission should contain all of your source code and a runnable binary of your program
(This requirement is excused if you have chosen a scripting language). Your program should process all the
unmodified files provided with this project in a single run of the program.
What We Are Looking For:
A user interface is not required, nor is a complicated command line interface. Simple console output is acceptable
as is writing the output to a file. We understand that this is a simple example but we would like you to take this
opportunity to apply as many best practices as you reasonably can, even if that means your solution borders on
being “over-engineered”. Giving us solid examples of your ability to write unit tests, use design patterns, interfaces
and/or classes, will give us a better understanding of your skill than implementing the requested functionality in as
few lines as possible.
